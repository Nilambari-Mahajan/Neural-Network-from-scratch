# Neural-Network-from-scratch
Overview

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing various deep learning concepts and functions, including activation functions and their derivatives, training neural networks, and related analyses.

Features

Sigmoid Activation Function: Implementation of the sigmoid function to map inputs to values between 0 and 1.

Derivative of Sigmoid Function: Computes the gradient for optimization purposes.

Additional implementations for deep learning tasks are included.

Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.7 or above

Numpy

Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

Install the dependencies using:
pip install numpy jupyter
Usage

Clone the repository or download the notebook file.

Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
jupyter notebook Copy_of_Nilambari_Mahajan_DeepLearninigLabAssignment.ipynb
Run the cells sequentially to execute the code.
